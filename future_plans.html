        <p>After I graduate from Neumont University I would like to be a Sysetem Administrator for a large technology company. I would like to move back to Northern Colorado to be closer to my family and friends. <img src="images.png" id="chip" class="rounded-corners shadow" /> I also want to move back to Northern Colorado so that I can be closer to the bigger mountains in Colorado and be able to go hangout with my friends and family in the mountains. I think that the mountains here are cool but the ones in Colorado are bigger and better.</p>
