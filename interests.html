        <p>I like to read in my spare time and I am currently reading <em>Shaken</em> by Tim Tebow and I am enjoying this book. I am also interested in photograpy; I mostly like to take pictures of nature and wildlife.<img src="IMG_1762_edit.gif" /> This is one of the pictues that I took over the last summer in Rocky Mountain National Park. I really like to take pictues in the mountians of Colorado because I konw them very well and they are so close to where I live meaning that I do not have to go very far to be in them.</p>
