        <p>To quote my amazingly annoying alliterative acquaintance <q>To fill up space pull something out of your intestines.</q> Some of my favorite sites to visit are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>I like Amazon becasue it is a great place to get anything that you need and have it shiped to your house for free if you have prime. I also think that Amazon has really good prices on almost everything that they sell.
            <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank"><img src="googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" /></a>I like Google because it is a website that I can look up whatever I want and it will help me to get to the best place to answer the question that I have at that time. I also like Google because it is a very common website that a lot of people use so I know that I can trust it.</p>
